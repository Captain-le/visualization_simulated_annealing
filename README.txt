1. Synopsis:
This project uses simulated annealing to solve the problem below and visualize each solution (location of the knot)
and improvement during simulated annealing.

2. How to run my code?
python main.py

3. What you will see?
The first figure shows each solution (location of the knot).
Then click the fork in upper right corner and you will the second figure which shows the improvement of simulated annealing.

4. Problem (link: https://www.luogu.com.cn/problem/P1337):
There are n weights, each of which is attached to a string of sufficient length.
Each string is passed through the hole in the tabletop from top to bottom and then tied together.
The x is the public knot. Assuming the rope is perfectly elastic (i.e. causes no loss of energy), the table is high enough and all friction is neglected, where x ends up in equilibrium.
